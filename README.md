# Pre-work - *Tipster*

**Tipster** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Malik Browne**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Keyboard does not go away when you touch screen with no input
- [X] Remembering the tip percentage across app restarts

## Notes

Building the initial part of the app was very simple. However it got really complicated when I started adding other features,
and delving away from the video. Ended up taking a bit longer than expected, but I am happy with the final result. I also
got a little too excited making the App Icon and coming up with a name.
